# Day 2 - Solana Payroll Program with Anchor

## 1. Stream Struct (lib.rs)
- **Purpose:** Stores the state of each payroll stream on-chain.
- **Fields:**
  - `employer`: Solana address of employer.
  - `employee`: Solana address of employee.
  - `start_time`: Timestamp when streaming begins (`i64` to support negative timestamps pre-1970).
  - `rate_per_second`: Tokens released per second.
  - `deposited_amount`: Total funds locked.
  - `claimed_amount`: Amount already claimed by employee.
- **Anchor Note:** `#[account]` marks this as a struct stored on a PDA (Program Derived Address).

**More:**
- `i64` for timestamp allows compatibility with Solana's clock and potential negative values.
- Negative timestamps represent dates before 1970 (Unix epoch).
- Maximum range for `i64` timestamps allows representing ~292 billion years.
- `Pubkey` represents addresses of employer and employee.
- `u64` is used for all amounts because token balances cannot be negative.

## 2. create_stream Instruction (lib.rs)
- **Purpose:** Initialize a payroll stream PDA with employer, employee, deposit, and streaming rate.
- **Process:**
  1. Access the PDA account via `ctx.accounts.stream`.
  2. Assign `employer` and `employee` keys.
  3. Set `start_time` using `Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp`.
  4. Set `rate_per_second`, `deposited_amount`, and initialize `claimed_amount` to 0.

**Syntax Details:**
- `Clock::get()?` fetches blockchain time; `?` propagates any error.
- `key()` method retrieves the public key of a Signer.
- `::` is Rustâ€™s namespace resolution operator.

## 3. PDA (Program Derived Address) Setup (lib.rs)
- **Purpose:** Ensures each stream account is unique and deterministic.
- **Seeds:** `['stream', employer_pubkey, employee_pubkey]`.
- **Space Calculation:**
  - 8 bytes for account discriminator
  - 32 bytes for employer Pubkey
  - 32 bytes for employee Pubkey
  - 8 bytes each for start_time, rate_per_second, deposited_amount, claimed_amount
  - **Total:** 8 + 32 + 32 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 104 bytes
- **Anchor Attributes:**
  - `init`: Create the PDA.
  - `payer`: Account paying for rent (usually employer).
  - `bump`: Ensures the PDA is valid.
- **Employee Account:** Can be unchecked because they are not required to sign at creation.

**More:**
- Calculating bytes precisely is critical to avoid allocation errors.
- Account discriminator (8 bytes) is added by Anchor automatically.

## 4. Anchor Test (tests/payroll.ts)
- **Purpose:** Test the create_stream instruction locally.
- **Steps:**
  1. Generate employee keypair and use provider wallet as employer.
  2. Compute PDA address using `findProgramAddress`.
  3. Call `createStream` via Anchor RPC method.
  4. Fetch the PDA data and assert fields match expected values.

**More:**
- Tests run on a local test validator (`solana-test-validator`).
- Anchor automatically funds the PDA from the employer wallet.
- Passing tests indicate correct initialization of on-chain stream state.

## 5. What Actually Happened When Test Ran
1. Anchor prepared a transaction calling `create_stream`.
2. Local test validator processed the transaction.
3. PDA account was created with proper space and rent paid.
4. Stream struct was initialized on-chain.
5. Test fetched the PDA data and verified all fields.
6. Test passed, confirming the program works locally.

**Conceptually:** You created your first **on-chain payroll stream instance** on a local Solana blockchain.
